<p>
A Random Variable is a variable that probabilistically takes on different values. You can think of an RV as
being like a variable in a programming language. They take on values, have types and have domains over
which they are applicable. We can define events that occur if the random variable takes one values that satisfy
a numerical test (eg does the variable equal 5, is the variable less than 8). We often think of the probabilities
of such events.
As an example, let’s say we flip three fair coins. We can define a random variable Y to be the total number
of “heads” on the three coins. We can ask about the probability of Y taking on different values using the
following notation:
</p>

<p>
<table>
	<tr>

<td style="min-width:200px">$\p(Y = 0)$ = 1/8 <td>(T, T, T)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>$\p(Y = 1)$ = 3/8 <td>(H, T, T), (T, H, T), (T, T, H)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>$\p(Y = 2)$ = 3/8 <td>(H, H, T), (H, T, H), (T, H, H)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>$\p(Y = 3)$ = 1/8 <td>(H, H, H)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>$\p(Y ≥ 4)$ = 0</td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>

<p>Even though we use the same notation for random variables and for events (both use capitol letters) they
are distinct concepts. An event is a scenario, a random variable is an object. The scenario where a random
variable takes on a particular value (or range of values) is an event. When possible, I will try and use letters
E,F,G for events and X,Y,Z for random variables.</p>

<p>Using random variables is a convenient notation technique that assists in decomposing problems. There are
many different types of random variables (indicator, binary, choice, Bernoulli, etc). The two main families of
random variable types are discrete and continuous. [todo explain discrete and continuous]. For now we are going to develop intuition around discrete
random variables</p>

<h2>How to describe a random variable</h2>

<p>
The definition of a random variable is the probabilities for all possible outcomes. The mapping from outcome to probability is generally called a "likelihood function". For discrete random variables we call this relationship the Probability Mass Function (PMF). For continuous random variables its called Probability Density Function (PDF).</p>

<p>Random variables have a name</p>

<p>
	Useful random variables also often have semantic meaning.

<p>
	For random variables there are numbers called "summary statistics" which tell you about key properties of the random variable. While they don't
