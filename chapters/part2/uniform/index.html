The most basic of all the continuous random variables is the uniform random variable, which is equally likely to take on any value in its range ($\alpha, \beta$). 

$X$ is a <i>uniform random variable</i> ($X \sim \Uni(\alpha, \beta)$) if it has PDF:
\begin{align*}
    f(x) = \begin{cases} \frac{1}{\beta - \alpha} &\text{when } \alpha \leq x \leq \beta \\ 
0 & \text{otherwise} \end{cases} 
\end{align*}
<p>
Notice how the density $1/(\beta - \alpha$) is exactly the same regardless of the value for $x$. That makes the density uniform. So why is the PDF $1/(\beta - \alpha)$ and not 1? That is the constant that makes it such that the integral over all possible inputs evaluates to 1.</p>

Let's work through a few key properties of this RV are. We can come up with a closed form for the probability that a uniform random variable $X$ is in the range $a$ to $b$, assuming that $\alpha \leq a \leq b \leq \beta$:
\begin{align*}
    \P(a \leq X \leq b) &= \int_a^b f(x) \d x \\
    &= \int_a^b \frac{1}{\beta - \alpha} \d x \\
    &= \frac{ b - a }{ \beta - \alpha } 
\end{align*}
