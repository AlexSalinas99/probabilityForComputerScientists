<center><h1>Probability Mass Functions</h1></center>
<hr/>

<p>For a discrete random variable, the most important thing to know is a mapping between the values that the random variable could take on and the probability of the random variable taking on said value. In mathematics,
we call associations functions.
The probability mass functions (PMF) is a function that maps possible outcomes of a random variable to the
corresponding probabilities. Because it is a function, we can plot PMF graphs where the x-axis are the values
that the random variable could take on and the y-axis is the probability of the random variable taking on said
value:</p>
