<center><h1>Probability Mass Functions</h1></center>
<hr/>

<p>For a discrete random variable, the most important thing to know is a mapping between the values that the random variable could take on and the probability of the random variable taking on said value. In mathematics,
we call associations functions.
The probability mass functions (PMF) is a function that maps possible outcomes of a random variable to the
corresponding probabilities. Because it is a function, we can plot PMF graphs where the x-axis are the values
that the random variable could take on and the y-axis is the probability of the random variable taking on said
value:</p>

<h2>Probabilities Must Sum to 1</h2>

For a variable (call it $X$) to be a proper random variable it must be the case that if you summed up the values of $\p(X = k)$ for all possible values $k$ that $X$ can take on, the result must be 1:
$$
\sum_{k} \p(X = k) = 1
$$
For further undertanding lets derive why this is the case. A random variable taking on a value is an event (for example $X = 2$)

<h2>Functions</h2>
<p> The "function" part of the name comes from the mathematical concept of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)">function</a>: it is a mapping from one number (representing a value the variable could take on) to another number (the corresponding probability of that variable taking on said value).</p>

<p>There are many ways that these Probability Mass Functions can be specified. One option is a normalized histogram</p>
