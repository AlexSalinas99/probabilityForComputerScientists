<p>Counting problems can be approached from the basic building blocks described in the first section: <a href="{{pathToLang}}part1/counting">Counting</a>. However some counting problems are so ubiquitous in the world of probability that it is worth knowing a few
higher level counting abstractions. When solving problems, if you can find the analogy from these canonical
examples you can build off of the corresponding combinatorics formulas:</p>

<h2>Permutations of Distinct Objects</h2>

<p>
	<div class="bordered">
		<p><b><i>Definition</i></b>: Permutation Rule</p>

		<p>A permutation is an ordered arrangement of n distinct object. Those $n$ objects can
be permuted in $n \cdot (n – 1) \cdot (n – 2)  \cdots 2  \cdot 1 = n!$ ways.</p>
	</div>
</p>


<h2>Permutations of In-Distinct Objects</h2>

<p>
	<div class="bordered">
		<p><b><i>Definition</i></b>: Permutations of In-Distinct Objects</p>

		<p>Generally when there are $n$ objects and:</p>
		<p class="indent">
$n_1$ are the same (indistinguishable) and<br/>
$n_2$ are the same and<br/>
...<br/>
$n_r$ are the same, then there are:

$$
\frac{n!}{n_1!n_2!\cdots n_r!}
$$
Distinct permutations.</p>
