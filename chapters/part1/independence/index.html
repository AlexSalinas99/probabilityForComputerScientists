	<p><b><i>Definition:</i></b> Independence</p>

	<p>Two events are said to be independent if knowing the outcome of one event does not change your belief about whether or not the other event will occur. For example, you might say that two separate dice rolls are independent of one another: the outcome of the first dice gives you no information about the outcome of the second -- and vice versa. </p>

	$$
	\p(E | F) = \p(E)
	$$

	This definition is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric_relation">symmetric</a>. If $E$ is independent of $F$, then $F$ is independent of $E$:
	$$
	\p(F | E) = \p(F)
$$</a>

	<h2>Conditional Independence</h2>
We saw earlier that the laws of probability still held if you consistently conditioned on an event. While the rules stay the same, the independence property might change. Events that were dependent can become independent when conditioning on an event. Events that were independent can become dependent.
