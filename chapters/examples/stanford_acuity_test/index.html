<div class="alert alert-primary"><b>History</b>: Did you know that an algorithm was invented <i>in</i> CS109? Back in Spring quarter 2017 there was a problem on the final exam which challenged students to use probability to do a better job of measuring how well someone can see. This grew into a collaboration with a former student, Ali Malik, as well as a Stanford eye doctor Charles Lin. The algorithm improved a few times, and now is one of the best algorithms (in theory if not in practice) for measuring how well someone can see!</div>

\begin{align*}
P(A=a|Y=0) &= \frac{P(Y=0|A=a)P(A=a)}{P(Y=0)} \\
&= \frac{P(Y=0|A=a)P(A=a)}{\sum_a P(Y=0, A=a)} \\
&= \frac{P(Y=0|A=a)P(A=a)}{\sum_a P(Y=0 | A=a)P(A=a)}
\end{align*}
