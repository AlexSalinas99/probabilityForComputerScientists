<center><h1>MLE of a Pareto Distribution</h1></center>
<hr/>

<p>You are creating artwork with different sized circles which follow a Pareto distribution:</p>
<p>$X \sim \text{Pareto}(\alpha)</p>
<p>Which is defined by a single parameter $\alpha$ and has PDF</p>
\begin{align*}
f(x) = \frac{\alpha}{x^{\alpha + 1}}
\end{align*}

<p>You would like the alpha in your artwork to match that of sand in your local beach. You go to the beachand collect 100 particles of sand and measure their size. Call the measured radii $x_1 , \dots, x_{100}$:
