<center><h1>Winning the Series</h1></center>
<hr/>

<p>Warriors are going to play the Bucks in a best of 7 series during the 2022 NBA finals. What is the probability that the warriors win the series? Each game is independent. Each game, the warriors have a 0.55 probability of winning. Win series if you win at least 4 games.</p>

<p><i>Note</i>: without loss of generality you could imagine that the two teams always play all 7 games, regardless of the outcome. Technically they stop playing after one team has achieved 4 wins, because the outcomes of the games no longer impact who wins. However, you could imagine that they continue.</p>

<p>What is the probability that the warriors win the series? Leave your answer to 3 decimal places</p>
