  <p><i>Acknowledgements: This book was written based on notes from Chris Piech for Stanford's CS109 course, Probability for Computer scientists using examples from Chris and Mehran Sahami. The course was originally designed by Mehran Sahami and followed the Sheldon Ross book Probability Theory from which we take inspiration. The course has since been taught by Lisa Yan, Jerry Cain and David Varodayan and their ideas and feedback have improved this reader. Special thanks to Robert Moss for drafting a PDF version.</i></p>
