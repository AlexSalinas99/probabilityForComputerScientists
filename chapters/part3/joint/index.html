<center><h1>Joint Probability</h1></center>
<hr/>

<p>
	Many interesting problems involve not one random variable, but rather several interacting with one another. In order to create interesting probabilistic <i>models</i> and to reason in real world situations, we are going to need to learn how to consider several random variables jointly.
</p>

<p>
	To give you a sense of some of the things that we are going to be working towards in this section:
	 How can we model multiple diseases and multiple possible symptoms so that we can predict probability of all diseases given a subset of observed symptops? How can you model the probability of a particular author writing a document full of words, and how could you use such a model to infer which author wrote which documents? How can we reason about what a person knows, say in maths, based on their responses to questions -- and how can we optimally chose a next question to ask them?
