<p>In this section we are going to use probability to analyze code. Specifically we are going to be calculating expectations on code: expected run time, expected resulting values etc. The reason that we are going to focus on expectation is that it has several <a href="{{pathToLang}}part2/expectation/">nice properties</a>. One of the most useful properties that we have seen so far is that the expectation of a sum, is the sum of expectations, <i>regardless</i> of whether the random variables are independent of one another. In this section we will see a few more helpful properties, including the Law of Total Expectation, which is also helpful in analyzing code.

	<b>Law of Total Expectation</b><br/>
	The law of total expectation gives you a way to calculate $\E[X]$ in the scenareo where it is easier to compute $\E[X|Y=y]$ where $Y$ is some other random variable:
	\begin{align*}
	\E[X] 
	&= \E\big[E[X|Y]\big] \\
	&= \sum_y \E[X|Y=y] \p(Y=y)
	\end{align*}
